1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:08,009
that both no re

2
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,910
No

3
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:18,098
one your and launch

4
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:23,125
the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as nasa terms
to the private sector

5
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,194
resupply

6
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,250
space

7
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:36,014
of a future where space bring
civilization

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,239
is a far more exciting and inspiring
future than one where we are not

9
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,088
capture is comprised

10
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:51,103
thank you say shit looks like we've got
us a dragon by the tail.

11
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:59,003
a long-term goals is to be able to

12
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,060
develop technology to transport millions
of people to mars

13
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,091
which will preserve the peace for
Humanity events for calamity

14
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:10,111
on on earth 0

15
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,109
absolutely think we would have a future
where humanity is

16
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,025
out there is falling stars and where we
have human civilization on mobile

17
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:18,078
planets

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,167
when the US government decided

19
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,280
stop funding the fe3+ cofounder case
Holland have fun motor

20
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:32,064
you on my stepped up to the plate he
invested $100 million dollars these own

21
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,107
money into faiths act

22
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:38,336
I was able to sit down with you on it
headquarters in southern california

23
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,450
to talk about how he's making space
explorations hot

24
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,590
of for the next generation the big
breakthrough that would have officially

25
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:45,133
the SpaceX

26
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,064
is to breed fully erect the reusable
rocket the reason that's so important

27
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:53,353
is that the the cost is the film the
option of is very low it's actually

28
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:54,250
about

29
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:58,034
.3 percent because the Rockets for up to
60 miles off the coast about

30
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,770
about talent is only about two hundred
thousand dollars if we're able to reuse

31
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,134
the Rockets pic be a dramatic

32
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,057
reduction in the cost thereof
spaceflight in one

33
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:09,726
fire you that well as a kid I I I
thought about

34
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,900
what would most affect the future of
humanity and I and I think

35
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,188
have faced it's fair to say in public
pretty obvious

36
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,110
most that a a future where space bring
civilizations

37
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,086
is a far more exciting inspiring future
than one worry of on Oct

38
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:28,157
even though in their follow 50 when I
was that has forced the finale

39
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:32,536
has both people went to the moon in
effect we always there

40
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,052
vicariously quality here

41
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,810
go as planned but fly in space
exploration for and you

42
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,159
can we be focusing on what's going on
here a largely agreed that

43
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:47,768
we should have a you ninety nine percent
plus

44
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,900
up our energy focus on solving problems
on earth

45
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,066
I'm but I think we need to a preserve a
small about

46
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:59,064
for a future beyond a you can say well
how much money should we spend

47
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:02,068
on on extended benefit face

48
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,115
there and so they should be far less
than we spent on health care

49
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:09,092
but maybe more than we spent on lipstick
I'm

50
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,471
and I I like we thank you to

51
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,670
nah known off from that attack benefits
they're just saying

52
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:20,144
I'm that you know we should probably
somewhere between those two numbers and

53
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:25,069
and them penny therefore it quits for
towards lower its actually enters

54
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:25,648
expenses

55
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,070
so you said that you your goal is to
eventually take

56
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:34,034
million parts multi-millions yeah going
to be

57
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:37,098
fun however will not support that is the
key threshold

58
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:41,119
I think I'm is is half-million dollars
to move some of

59
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,056
wife at in order to achieve that you
have to first we'll have a fully

60
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:45,147
reusable system

61
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:49,186
that's 12 months back a hotfix the
rights

62
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,637
up for health combination I think with
with methane

63
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,400
a fifth in Austin you can do it if
someone were to

64
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,040
work hard save money and really have
that as their goal

65
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:02,795
that by the time they fade if they're
sorta amid mid-flight for you

66
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,511
most people in america good could do
that if they let their guard saving up

67
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,871
yes and then of course you sell your
house to any and all your belongings on

68
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,430
earth does

69
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,138
you're moving flies it's not this I mean
I still have my dog for a case that is

70
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:20,427
would be crazy fit your numbers there
you sell your cell you can either

71
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,870
you help half an hour for you have a
free returns think about whether a tenth

72
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,131
3 the spacecraft faxer I okay you

73
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,090
lot of times actually people one walk
upon bike so far more success is not one

74
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:32,838
possible outcome

75
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,020
I'm this case I think success has won
the possible outcomes that doesn't mean

76
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,002
we will achieve it but

77
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:43,019
I've carpet at the point that if
possible while half a million dollars

78
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,468
sounds expensive

79
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,370
remember that the russians once offer
trips for $35 million dollars just to go

80
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,072
to the space station

81
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:55,147
well creating a civilization on mars
found a little tough it's certainly not

82
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,084
going to stop you on my

83
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:02,253
from achieving his dream one day
colonizing the red planet what advice do

84
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,520
you have for young people

85
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:07,060
work training and history I do think

86
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,101
more people should study in Syrian
science and

87
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:15,096
actually I say particularly engineering
because engineering is the

88
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,525
oppose this thing to magic that exists
in the real world engineering is

89
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,420
creating some new

90
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,800
device or that that never existed before

91
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:26,062
and neck back to do things today the

92
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:30,121
that would be considered magic hundreds
of years ago it's pretty amazing what's

93
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:31,052
a

94
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:34,451
what what do we can create images and

95
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,870
your holograms things like that and and
all these things would have

96
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,666
got your burned at the stake I'm you

97
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,546
for years ago when is the next call
crash what nextag.com free and

98
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,020
what industry should they be now well

99
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:53,046
I think and their opportunities in
energy sustainable energy

100
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:56,155
and artificial intelligence

101
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,570
and

102
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,126
and genetics as a polio-free

103
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:05,042
the three big areas and what advice do
you have for young people who are trying

104
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,063
to get their startups of

105
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:10,064
I think the that the thing to do is to
try to create

106
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:14,074
a demonstration article everything works
on PowerPoint but

107
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,083
if you actually have the physical item
for the software you know some

108
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,102
demonstration software

109
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:22,043
that that's much more convincing people
that a powerful presentation or or any

110
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:24,117
business plan give an internship program

111
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,061
here can you tell me a little bit about
fat yes we we we hire

112
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:31,067
actually quite a few interns the here's
a couple hundred a year

113
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:35,069
a record you're looking for evidence for
exceptional abilities so

114
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,086
I you have somebody competed in like a
design will fly competition

115
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:43,113
or a Formula SAE racing wanna States

116
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:47,057
science fair where they do that sorta as
evidence a

117
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:50,116
exceptional voted in one form or another
GPS is one

118
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:54,032
one element actors but slightly higher
weighting on

119
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:57,040
having one some sort of competition so

120
00:06:57,004 --> 00:07:00,013
someone for me before this interview
that you work you

121
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,134
well I'm a test yeah why did you decide
to do that

122
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,125
well I think it's important to maximize
vacation much more sativa

123
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:11,106
the serve that the Spartans to afford
I'm

124
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,052
so I i care about. effective execution

125
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,075
at the company and the more you insulate
yourself from

126
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,111
information for all be back in the
company the worse

127
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,096
decisions he made this is the third
successful venture for you on my

128
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:29,115
he's got degrees in both physics and
business

129
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:34,038
and he promotes sciences the pathway to
success for the next generation

130
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,122
how does a recession back to companies
like SpaceX have you often

131
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:42,037
back the recession we've actually done
recent reasonably well actually

132
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:45,112
and in California yeah yeah their work
we've done fairly well

133
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:49,063
I will continue to grow ok throughout
the recession

134
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:54,069
and that really really hasn't had a
negative effect on SpaceX

135
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,095
we might have grown slightly faster but
we grew very fast

136
00:07:57,095 --> 00:08:00,156
and I do better with such basics it's
like Valley

137
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:05,123
or some california and the end I said to
use that some help with mister

138
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,029
a larger bases aerospace engineering
talent in Southern California

139
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,138
but then with has the a test actually
this

140
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,067
but more in in in Northern California
because

141
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,119
electric cars you think about the
problems with the associated with that

142
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,087
it sort of software engineering
electrical engineering its its batteries

143
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,128
skills that are actually better

144
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:28,094
in Northern California California's
state needs to be cautious about

145
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:31,169
I'm the level of taxation and regulation
that better price

146
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:35,157
yeah I'm surprised that your base here
well

147
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,112
you know when I started pick two
companies

148
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:44,107
the California max that at the Marshall
factor in california is 9 percent I

149
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:45,081
think it's now

150
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,120
almost 14 percent that's a fifty percent
increase

151
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:53,065
success of the company's and its me it
makes a progressively harder to to hire

152
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:53,142
people

153
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:57,042
I'm and two to compensate them had a
lovely

154
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,097
if we're competing against companies
that are in states that have

155
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:04,122
02 low personal tax or in countries that
arm

156
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:08,046
a much cheaper to operate in it's
fortunate that California's is

157
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,101
is a great place to live help we must be
careful not to two over regulate

158
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,067
companies

159
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:15,072
in in the state make difficult to
operate so you know

160
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,056
your technology why is that why did you
make that

161
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:22,144
well at SpaceX we don't and at times
that we do

162
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,047
I'm would have gotten anything that hard
to

163
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:29,086
to determine just by looking at the
Rockets gonna send the

164
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:32,132
technology just by looking at the rocket
them then we will sometimes

165
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,075
issue a patent what we want pat is
anything that's hidden or hard to

166
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,138
determine

167
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:41,117
about technology russia today in China
long-term our toughest competitors I

168
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:42,108
think we would have some

169
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,023
some challenge enforcing a patent suit
against the Chinese or Russian

170
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:50,096
government so up until recently when
people think I'm space exploration they

171
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,133
think that that is the role of the
federal government

172
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:57,107
for do you think your business your
company is just asking who are perhaps

173
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,086
more capable of well

174
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:03,094
I think I think that that the likely
solution is going to be some combination

175
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:06,193
over a private and and government
efforts are not completely private

176
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:10,137
no I don't think it's like to become
fully privatized ok but I do think it's

177
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,058
likely to be majority

178
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:15,061
private and coming to be quite helpful
in in the beginning

179
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,066
while I'm in a very much for proponents
have a free market

180
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,015
there's limited role for government in
certain certain areas

181
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:26,053
particularly where two large expenditure
but it provides a small amount so good

182
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:26,130
for the whole

183
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,099
the whole country something like that
the hubble space telescope is a good

184
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:30,092
example

185
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:33,166
I'm you know what we learnt a great deal
about about universe we got these

186
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:34,142
incredible

187
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:38,095
images and they're just so the stunning
images I think it really

188
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,194
it was helpful and inspiring kids to
study engineering and science like

189
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:42,159
anything

190
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,117
to learn more about that and life has to
be about more than just solving problems

191
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:47,096
it can't be

192
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:50,133
that all you all you do is wake up and
just for

193
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,094
solve one was for power know they have
to be exciting inspiring events that

194
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,168
make life worth living in the first
place

195
00:10:56,068 --> 00:11:00,166
against all odds you on moscow is
inspiring a new generation of explorers

196
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,073
and innovators

197
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:07,036
who believe that space travel is
possible for everyday people

198
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:11,057
not in some faraway time but in the very
near future

199
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:14,073
for next-generation TV i'm michelle feel

200
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,138
could be
